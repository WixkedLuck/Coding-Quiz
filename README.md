# Module-4-Challenge
This is challenge 4 for UoM

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a quiz generator that uses JavaScript as its main application. As I continue further into my web developer career I may come across a typical coding assessment to assess my skills. 

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with JavaScript elements such as objects and functions. I also used this time to further my css and html knowledge by adding key features I learned in class.  
 

- I built this project to further my understanding of JavaScript and practice what I have learned in class. Creating this quiz helped me learn the basic fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery. 

- This project resolves around having an interactive quiz that has a timer that is used to create a local high score. When a user gets a question wrong the time is deducted and this can affect the person's score. Once the quiz is complete the user is greeted with the top 10 leader board, which later can be reset. 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on JavaScript elements and completion of an online quiz generator that keeps local storage elements for a high score leaderboard.
